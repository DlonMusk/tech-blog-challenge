# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description

For this challenge we were tasked with building a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was completely built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
